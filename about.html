            Hey there! My name is Joel (a.k.a. Doel Javid, or racer995 on
            Roblox). I do lots of things, ranging from programming, to graphic
            design, to even making baked goods at home. I hope to show my
            skills to the whole world and to glorify my God in the process.

        <details>
          <summary>When did you start programming?</summary>
          I actually started messing around with computer software many years
          back, when I was a child, but I can't quite pin the date. I believe
          I tried to make games using the Unity game engine a while back, but
          my child brain couldn't understand computer code at the time, so I
          simply gave up on it for a while. I would actually pick up scripting
          on Roblox when I made a basic teleporter script. I've been learning
          to program ever since that.

          <summary>What's your favorite programming language?</summary>
          My favorite programming language I would say is Lua. I know, it's
          convenient since I started programming on Roblox. I love the language
          because it's very simple to understand yet at the same time packs a
          lot of power. I do like Roblox's version of Lua, Luau, but part of
          me wishes I can use the language effectively at a system level.

          <summary>What are some of your favorite hobbies?</summary>
          As mentioned in the summary above, I like to code programs, websites,
          and games. I also like to make baked goods at home, and I also like
          to make pixel art and vector graphics. In addition, I also love to
          read the Bible daily, I love to play videogames every now and then,
          and I also like to collect Beyblades as a hobby. Overall, I'd say I
          have a whole lot of hobbies I like, and I'd also say I love them all
          the same.
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>What is your favorite videogame?</summary>
          This is a hard question to answer, because there's a lot of games I
          like, including Minecraft, Pac-Man, Mario Kart, and others. I also
          really love Pizza Tower. (My art style actually draws a lot of
          inspiration from that specific game.) I can say that my favorite
          videogame franchise is the Oddword franchise, since I love the
          story-telling and world-building involved in the game. It's ironic,
          since I was originally thinking that I would never touch the
          franchise due to it's dark and creepy atmosphere, until I was finally
          inspired to play the remaster of the game, "New 'n Tasty", after
          watching a bunch of videos on the game. In conclusion, while I can't
          name my favorite videogame overall, my favorite franchise is
          Oddworld.

          <summary>Where did you get the idea for the username "Doel Javid"?</summary>
          The idea for the name "Doel Javid" came from my dad, who scrambed my
          first and middle name. Fun fact: the scrambled name is pronounced
          similar to the canned pineapple brand, Dole, which is why my dad
          would also call me by the nickname "Pineapple". That nickname was
          what inspired all the pineapple designs in this website. While my
          internet name is Doel Javid, I'm not affiliated with the Dole brand
          in any way, shape or form.

          <summary>What's up with the wierd pineapple man on the home screen?</summary>
          The pineapple man is "Doel Javid", a character that I made up. In no
          way is he related to me whatsoever. In fact, he's everything but me!
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Where do you live?</summary>
          I'm not really willing to disclose my exact location to the public.
          I'll only say that I'm located in Ohio, USA.
