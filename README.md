Doel Javid's Public Portfolio
===============================================================================

This is my public portfolio made for Codecademy. This project is not to be
mistaken for [doeljavid.me](https://doeljavid.me). This is a simple static
website using GitHub pages, and it internally uses some other APIs and
components to add additional functions to it.

## Credits

This project uses [Anime.js](https://animejs.com/) to control animations.
All other assets are made by me.
